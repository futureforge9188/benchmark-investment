### Explanation:
1. **Structure**: The HTML structure mirrors that of the original `swp-calculator.html`, maintaining the same layout and sections.
2. **Styling**: The styles are consistent with the original file, using the same classes and structure to ensure a cohesive look.
3. **Functionality**: The JavaScript functions handle input synchronization, SWP calculations, result updates, and chart rendering, similar to the original file.
4. **Chart.js**: The chart is created using Chart.js, displaying the balance over time based on the inputs.

### Usage:
- Save this code as `SWPCalc.html` in the same directory as your other files.
- Ensure that the `style.css` file is linked correctly and contains the necessary styles for the classes used in this HTML file.
